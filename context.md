# Nudge: Card-Based To-Do App

## Core Concept
Nudge is a To-Do list application with a unique card-based interface. Each task is represented as a card in a deck, making task management more engaging and interactive.

## Key Features

### Card Interface
- **Cards as Tasks**: Each to-do item is represented as a card
- **Deck Structure**: Daily tasks are organized as a stack of cards
- **Swipe Gestures**: 
  - Swipe right to mark a task as completed
  - Swipe left to postpone a task to the next day
- **Visual Feedback**: Cards provide visual cues during interactions

### Task Management
- **Daily Task Decks**: Each day has its own deck of tasks
- **Task Prioritization**: Tasks can have different priority levels (high, medium, low)
- **Task Postponement**: Easy rescheduling of tasks to the next day
- **Task Completion**: Simple gesture to mark tasks as done

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Expo & Expo Router
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated
- **Gesture Handling**: React Native Gesture Handler or React Native Deck Swiper
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage or SQLite via Expo

### Component Structure
1. **Card Component**:
   - Visual representation of a task
   - Priority indicator
   - Title and description display
   - Styling based on priority

2. **Card Deck**:
   - Stacked appearance with visible cards beneath the top card
   - Counter showing current position in the deck
   - Animation for transitioning between cards

3. **Daily View**:
   - Shows the current day's task deck
   - Header with date information
   - Instructions for card interactions

### Animation Considerations
- **Smooth Transitions**: Cards should animate smoothly when swiped
- **Visual Feedback**: Color changes or other visual cues during swipe actions
- **Physics-Based Animations**: Natural-feeling card movements
- **Performance Optimization**: Careful management of JS thread and UI thread

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  priority?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  completed?: boolean;
}

// Tasks organized by date
type TasksByDate = Record<string, Task[]>;
```

## UI/UX Design
- **Card Design**: Clean, attractive cards with priority indicators
- **Stacked Appearance**: Subtle indication of additional cards in the deck
- **Progress Indicator**: Show how many cards remain in the deck
- **Empty State**: Friendly message when all tasks are complete
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Support for both themes

## Implementation Challenges
- **Animation Performance**: Ensuring smooth animations without overloading the JS thread
- **Gesture Handling**: Properly managing swipe gestures and animations
- **State Synchronization**: Keeping UI state and data model in sync
- **Reanimated Threading**: Proper use of worklets and shared values

## Future Enhancements
- Calendar view to navigate between days
- Statistics on task completion
- Recurring tasks
- Task categories or tags
- Cloud synchronization
- Notifications and reminders
